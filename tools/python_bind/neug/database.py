            Note that in memory mode, the database will not be persisted to disk, and all data will be

        mode : str
            Mode to open the database, could be 'r', 'read', 'readwrite', 'w', 'rw', 'write'. Default is 'r' for read-only.
        max_thread_num : int
            Maximum database thread count. Default is 0, which means
            auto-select from hardware concurrency and fall back to 1 if the
            runtime cannot detect it.
        checkpoint_on_close : bool
            Whether to automatically create a checkpoint when the database is closed. Default is True.
            If False, no checkpoint is created automatically when close the database.
        buffer_strategy : str
            Buffer strategy to use for the database, could be 'InMemory' (or 'M_FULL'), 'SyncToFile' (or 'M_LAZY')
            or 'HugePagePreferred' (or 'M_HUGE'). Default is 'M_FULL'.
            - 'InMemory' / 'M_FULL': The database will be opened fully in memory, and the changes will not be
              persisted to disk until checkpoint is created.
            - 'SyncToFile' / 'M_LAZY': The database will be opened in memory on demand, suitable for large databases
              that cannot fit into memory. Also changes will not be persisted to disk until checkpoint is created.
            - 'HugePagePreferred' / 'M_HUGE': Similar to 'InMemory', but it will try to use huge pages for memory
              allocation, which may improve performance for large databases.
